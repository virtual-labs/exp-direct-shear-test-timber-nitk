**OBJECTIVE**:

To determine experimentally, the ultimate shear strength of timber.

**STEPS**:

1. Click on the direct shear test on timber file , a window will open as shown below.

6. Load is applied till failure of the specimen and the machine is switched off.

7. The double shear strength on mild steel plate is shown in the tabular column.
